					<table width="85%" align="center"><tr><td><H2 class="title">Welcome <%=firstName%> <%=lastName%>!</H2>
					We will give you a quick introduction before you start submitting a model to the MMHCC Cancer Models Database.<br>
Alternatively, you can take the <a href="guided_tour/index.html" target="_blank"><font size="+1">&quot;Guided Tour&quot;</font></a> or refer to the <a href="help.html" target="_blank"><font size="+1">Help Documentation</font></a>.<br><br>
For each new model it is necessary to complete the information on the <b>&quot;General Information page&quot;</b>. Required fields on this page are:<ul>
<li>Model Descriptor</li>
<li>PI's Email Address</li>
<li>Species of the Model</li>
<li>Phenotype</li>
<li>Record Release Date</li>
</ul>
After you are have submitted these data the program will open the <b>&quot;Main page&quot;</b> which contains <b>links to all parts</b> of the submission process. <br><br>You have to <b>fill out only the parts that apply to your model</b>, e.g. if your model was not exposed to carcinogenic agents you don't have to enter data about carcinogenic agents. <br><br>You can make <b>multiple entries for each category</b>, e.g. if the model was exposed to two different chemicals or if the model was used in multiple therapeutic trials.<br><br>
If you <b>cannot complete the submission</b> of the model in one session you can come back later and add data.
